# Epic Rap Battles of History
# Seong Gi-hun vs. Mr. Beast
Mr. Beast:
Welcome to your final test, I'm MrBeast.
We can scrap the 'S' cuz I've never missed a beat!
You had to cut from honey under threat of a gun blast;
When I had a cut from Honey, that's another check that I'm gonna cash!
You're coming last, Number 1 is Jimmy; only dub you have is horribly written.
You're accomplished 'cuz you fought the opposition and became the best,
But the consequences that you've got to live with
Is you paved their deaths all to pay your debt, I applaud you Gi-Hun!
In the diss game, you won't get rich.
I'm like your momma: I'm dead sick!
Then check the gaming channel, millions of children watch it.
How'd you win all that Won, kid, but not custody of one kid?
Did ya think you'd get her back with that lighter you bought her?
You're playing tug-o-war with your ex, but the rope is your daughter (Ooh!)
So stupid, Sang-woo showed you the light; you didn't go to SNU, that's right.
If the task was last to get backstabbed by a pal, you wouldn't make it through the night!
When I feast I don't need a suit and tie, wrapping with gold like the food I try!
Utter a word then you will die, save those subs for PewDiePie!
# Dream vs. Rosa Parks
Dream:
You were always in the back,
I was always in the front.
