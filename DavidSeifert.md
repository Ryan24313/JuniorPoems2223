#Luke's drinking problem

Luke, with Gatorade in hand,
A thirst that he couldn't stand.
He guzzled it down, day and night,
His addiction, a constant plight.

He'd drink it at work and at play,
His coworkers would often say
"Luke, slow down, it's not that dire,
You'll be fine, just drink some water."

But Luke would just shrug and grin,
His love for Gatorade, a sin.
He couldn't stop, no matter the cost,
His addiction, he'd pay the cost.

Luke's Gatorade problem grew worse,
His health, a constant curse.
He couldn't see the damage done,
His addiction, a battle he'd never won.

So let this be a cautionary tale,
Of Gatorade addiction and its frail.
Drink in moderation, my friend,
Or your health, in the end, may bend.
