# The Faded Man
A man sat near the bonfire
near the end of his journey.
His actions, his choices,
all lead to one point, that will never arrive.
For he is a memory for others,
a light for the hopeless and the eyes for the blind.
A memory that protects the new, and a memory to help the old.
For his name was unknown.
A faded man for the faded world, 
a world that never existed.
Adventures that never could be completed.
For this was the end of the game.
A idea for a game that a faded man once had,
abondon when he grew.
Now only a memory for him. 
A memory of what he could had.
