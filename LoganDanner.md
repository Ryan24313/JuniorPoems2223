There was a man named Christian who got kicked for inactivity
He was a great emo boy who never came to school
Therefore although his name was Christian he was not a Christian
He really was a fool
For this was a great class 
But alas he never came to school
He ran off to Istanbul
It was a fancy city in a country known as Turkey
Where they tend to sell a lot of beef jerkey
As his days ran out he met the worst fate
He never even came to school late
Christian was a very nice man 
It was too bad he got perma-banned
